# Open Beacon Plastic Cases

Project Overview

The Open Beacon Plastic Cases project was designed by Additive Manufactory Factory Lab, University of Zurich, in partnership with the Center of Child Well-being and Development, University of Zurich. The project aims to provide protective cases for open beacon sensors used in field deployments.

Purpose

The plastic cases are specifically designed to safeguard open beacon sensors during their deployment in various field scenarios. These cases ensure the protection of the sensors from environmental elements, such as water and dust, while maintaining their functionality.

Features

Water and Dust Resistance: The plastic cases are constructed to be water-resistant and dust-resistant, safeguarding the open beacon sensors in different field conditions.

Reliability: The plastic cases have been successfully utilized in several field pilots, demonstrating their reliability and durability in real-world conditions.

Composition: Each plastic case consists of four parts: a top part, a bottom part, a rubber sealing, and a screw. This design ensures secure encasement of the open beacon sensors.

Signal Interference: The material used in the plastic cases introduces only minor interference in the antenna signal of the open beacon sensors. This interference does not pose a risk to the data quality as long as attenuation can be adjusted in the firmware of the sensors. The screw also does not introduce relevant interference. The sensors should be placed into the case in the suggested position.

Convenient Attachment: The plastic cases feature a plastic clip that allows users to conveniently attach the cases to their clothes. Ideally, the attachment should be at chest height to ensure accurate sensor readings.

Deployment

The plastic cases have been successfully deployed in both adults and children. Their effectiveness has been verified through field deployments and usage in various scenarios.
